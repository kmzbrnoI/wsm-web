## I want to try it!

Ok, we usually have some prototypes at [Model Railroader Club in
Brno](https://kmz-brno.cz/), Czech Republic. Just send an e-mail to the
[autor](/en/about) and we can arrange aÂ meeting.

## I want to buy it!

Contact the [author](/en/about), he sometimes creates a series of WSMs.

## I want to build it!

No problem, all materials are opensource. All links are in project's parts (use
the menu on right). You may download it and create the WSM yourself.
