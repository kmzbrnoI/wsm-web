## I want to try it!

Ok, we usually have some prototypes at [Model Railroader Club in
Brno](https://kmz-brno.cz/), Czech Republic. Just send an e-mail to the
[autor](/about) and we can arrange a meeting.

## I want to buy it!

Currently, there is no option of purchasing a WSM as a packaged single piece of
hardware officially. However, the [author](/about) usually has some spare
parts, so you may contact him and hopefully arrange a purchase.
